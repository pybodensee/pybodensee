If you are starting with Python Programming Language, then the following are some of the tips that can help you to become fluent in Python. 

## Stick to your Learning Plan!

Most people starting with any new adventure e.g. learning a Programming language will give up too soon. When it comes to learning new programming languages it usually boils down to either not having proper learning or not following a plan for long enough. You should do the following to learn and get better in Python.

### Tip 1: Code every day
One of the best advice is to code every day for any of your daily tasks. You will notice a surprise increase in your learning skills and productivity on a day-to-day basis. 

### Tip 2: Write It Out

If you are having a long list of tasks/functions or a complex coding problem then it is recommended to write it down. Take a piece of paper and write down the list of tasks or data flow diagram (DFD) of your algorithms. Although you can write them in a digital format (e.g. in a Computer/Tablet), my experience says that paper/pencil-based writing is much more effective.


### Tip 3: Go Interactive!

If your problem requires interactive solutions or you have an interactive personality then it is highly recommended that you explore interactive approaches/methods to write your codes. This includes using interactive Programming interfaces e.g. Jupyter or writing your interface for the current project. 

For example, if your tasks include 3D point cloud processing then you can extend your existing code environment to include a 3D visualization. If this is not possible, then you might think about creating an interactive programming environment where you can easily program.

### Tip 4: Take Breaks

An underrated but highly effective skill for programmers is to take effective breaks from their coding. be it a couple of seconds every 10 minutes or 10 minutes after every hour they are essential for productivity boost and improved cognitive thinking for creative code writing.

### Tip 5: Become a Bug Bounty Hunter
Lots of organizations around the globe offer bug bounty programs to hunt bugs in their software/websites. The idea is to ask the General Public, Bug bounty hunters, and ethical hackers to look into the software/website and point out system critical errors. 

This is a great opportunity not only to learn new programming techniques but also to each money through it. Remember a Golden rule, the bigger the Bug Bounty is the higher the required expertise. 


## Collaborative Learning is the way to Go!

Another aspect of learning and improving your code quality is to use a collaborative approach. Following are some of the techniques to improve your code. 

### Tip 6: Surround Yourself With Others Who Are Learning

This is a piece of great advice for those who are starting. If you are beginning your Python learning journey then it is recommended to surround yourself with other people who are also new to learning Python. 

This approach is very effective and has proved to work in most cases as humans learn well in groups e.g. in Bootcamps, Universities, and Schools. 

### Tip 7: Teach What You Learn

Teaching is another great activity for improving your already learned concepts. This might not work well for everyone but is very useful for those who are naturally gifted with teaching skills.

### Tip 8: Pair Programming

Another collaborative learning technique is Pair Programming in which more than one people work together to solve a programming task. If you are a beginner and a new learner you will have massive improvements in your programming skills. 

You would be able to learn from the coding style and problem-solving approach of your peers. If done effectively everyone will be able to raise their programming standards and get benefit from others. 


### Tip 9: Contribute to Open-source Projects

You can also consider contributing to open-source projects. Look on GitHub or GitLab where most of the open-source projects are available. Here you can search for Python-related projects that might be of interest. Look into open issues on those projects and start fixing bugs or adding new features. 

The most effective part of contributing to an open-source project is that you start reading code written by others. This will help you understand how and why others are writing code in a specific way. Most of the time, you will notice that Good open-source Python projects use Python standards for programming scripts/GUIs e.g. PEP-8 standard for Python programming style and structure.

## Develop Awesome but Helpful Projects

In the beginning, it's perfectly fine to design a Calculator app or Todo List app. If you want to excel in your programming then it is recommended that you get out of this todo app app dilemma and develop something else. Your best bet would be to take on any project from your daily life and build it yourself. Start step by step and develop a full-fledged application that will suit your needs.

Here, the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle will be your best friend. Write clean code in tiny but useful/reusable functions. Think of a big software project as writing a novel, make it interesting and joyful to use by others. Unmaintainable software dies very soon, hence you should make sure that your software code is readable and extendable (in case someone to fix a bug to modify it as per their need in the future.)

## Best Python Resources to learn Python

Following are my top three resources to learn Python, and can highly recommend them to someone starting up with Python.

If you are stuck in any situation and need help regarding your Python Problems then the following are the best places to look for help.

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) — It's a community-driven Question and answers website where people discuss programming issues. For Python-specific topics check [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python). Remember one rule no questions for stupid/dumb. We are all learning. Asking Great Questions is awesome and you should work on asking them.


- [Google](https://www.google.com/) — The most commonly used tool of any experienced programmer. Just ask your question in the Google Search bar to go through the answers.
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) — A good place to find reference material on Python.
- ChatGPT could be also your good friend. Since ChatGPT is the least recommended source for beginners ChatGPT spits out some code that might/might not work out at first instance and you might spend more time fixing it out rather than solving your original problem.
