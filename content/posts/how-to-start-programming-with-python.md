If you are starting with Python Programming Language, then the following are some of the tips that can help you to become fluent in Python. 

## Stick to your Learning Plan!

Most people starting with any new adventure e.g. learning a Programming language will give up too soon. When it comes to learning new programming languages it usually boils down to either not having proper learning or not following a plan for long enough. You should do the following to learn and get better in Python.


## Your everyday companion

Think of using a Python console as your calculator. Every time you want to do some calculations, make it your habit to use Python for this. 

## Code every day
One of the best advice is to code every day for any of your daily tasks. You will notice a surprise increase in your learning skills and productivity on a day-to-day basis. 


## Write down your thoughts

If you are having a long list of tasks/functions or a complex coding problem then it is recommended to write it down. Take a piece of paper and write down the list of tasks or data flow diagram (DFD) of your algorithms. 

Although you can write them in a digital format (e.g. in a Computer/Tablet), my experience says that paper/pencil-based writing is much more effective.


## Interactive Coding

If your problem requires interactive solutions or you have an interactive personality then it is highly recommended that you explore interactive approaches/methods to write your codes. This includes using interactive Programming interfaces e.g. Jupyter or writing your interface for the current project. 

For example, if your tasks include 3D point cloud processing then you can extend your existing code environment to include a 3D visualization. If this is not possible, then you might think about creating an interactive programming environment where you can easily program.

## Bug Bounty Hunter
Lots of organizations around the globe offer bug bounty programs to hunt bugs in their software/websites. The idea is to ask the General Public, Bug bounty hunters, and ethical hackers to look into the software/website and point out system critical errors. 

This is a great opportunity not only to learn new programming techniques but also to each money through it. Remember a Golden rule, the bigger the Bug Bounty is the higher the required expertise.
