Following are my top four resources to learn Python, and can highly recommend them to someone starting up with Python.

If you are stuck in any situation and need help regarding your Python Problems then the following are the best places to look for help.

### StackOverflow

[StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) — It's a community-driven Question and answers website where people discuss programming issues. For Python-specific topics check [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python). Remember one rule no questions for stupid/dumb. We are all learning. Asking Great Questions is awesome and you should work on asking them.

### Google Search Engine

[Google](https://www.google.com/) — The most commonly used tool of any experienced programmer. Just ask your question in the Google Search bar to go through the answers.

### Python Documentation

[Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) — A good place to find reference material on Python.


### ChatGPT

ChatGPT could be also your good friend. Since ChatGPT is the least recommended source for beginners ChatGPT spits out some code that might/might not work out at first instance and you might spend more time fixing it out rather than solving your original problem.
