In the beginning, it's perfectly fine to design a Calculator app or Todo List app. If you want to excel in your programming then it is recommended that you get out of this todo app app dilemma and develop something else. These notes were taken during the [First meetup](/meetups/meetup-1-establishment-of-pybodensee-user-group/) of PyBodensee on 15th May 2024.

## Keep it Useful
Your best bet would be to take on any project from your daily life and build it yourself. Start step by step and develop a full-fledged application that will suit your needs.

## Keep it Simple
Here, the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle will be your best friend. Write clean code in tiny but useful/reusable functions. Think of a big software project as writing a novel, make it interesting and joyful to use by others. 

## Keep it Maintainable
Unmaintainable software dies very soon, hence you should make sure that your software code is readable and extendable (in case someone to fix a bug to modify it as per their need in the future.)

# Keep it Scalable

After you have gained some experience with Python and started developing interesting and cool projects, it is highly recommended to design your projects carefully. An important aspect that is neglected by newbie is the scalability of their project. 

Take a close look at the dependencies of your project. As a newbie, it is easy to just ``pip install foolibrary`` and start working. However, things can go wrong if you have not analyzed the ``foolibrary`` beforehand, because it may not be scalable, have many bugs, or is already abundant.

If these scenarios occur, then your project may not work in certain installations and you may have to restart.
