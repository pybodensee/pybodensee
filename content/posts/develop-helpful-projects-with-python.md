In the beginning, it's perfectly fine to design a Calculator app or Todo List app. If you want to excel in your programming then it is recommended that you get out of this todo app app dilemma and develop something else. 

## Keep it Useful
Your best bet would be to take on any project from your daily life and build it yourself. Start step by step and develop a full-fledged application that will suit your needs.

## Keep it Simple
Here, the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle will be your best friend. Write clean code in tiny but useful/reusable functions. Think of a big software project as writing a novel, make it interesting and joyful to use by others. 

## Keep it Maintainable
Unmaintainable software dies very soon, hence you should make sure that your software code is readable and extendable (in case someone to fix a bug to modify it as per their need in the future.)
