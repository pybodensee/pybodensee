Another aspect of learning and improving your Python code quality is to use a collaborative approach. Following are some of the techniques to improve your code. 

### Join Other Python Learners

This is a piece of great advice for those who are starting. If you are beginning your Python learning journey then it is recommended to surround yourself with other people who are also new to learning Python. 

This approach is very effective and has proved to work in most cases as humans learn well in groups e.g. in Bootcamps, Universities, and Schools. 

### Teach What You Learn

Teaching is another great activity for improving your already learned concepts. This might not work well for everyone but is very useful for those who are naturally gifted with teaching skills.

### Pair Programming

Another collaborative learning technique is Pair Programming in which more than one people work together to solve a programming task. If you are a beginner and a new learner you will have massive improvements in your programming skills. 

You would be able to learn from the coding style and problem-solving approach of your peers. If done effectively everyone will be able to raise their programming standards and get benefit from others. 


### Contribute to Open-source Projects

You can also consider contributing to open-source projects. Look on GitHub or GitLab where most of the open-source projects are available. Here you can search for Python-related projects that might be of interest. Look into open issues on those projects and start fixing bugs or adding new features. 

The most effective part of contributing to an open-source project is that you start reading code written by others. This will help you understand how and why others are writing code in a specific way. Most of the time, you will notice that Good open-source Python projects use Python standards for programming scripts/GUIs e.g. PEP-8 standard for Python programming style and structure.
